# ML_Traiding

## Plan:
- Implement MA using Python on the EURUSD_1H data (In progress)
- Make a standard ARIMA based model (In progress), see [ML_ARIMA.ipynb](https://github.com/viktor-begun/ML_Traiding/blob/main/ML_Arima.ipynb)
    - Explanation of SARIMAX
- Make the LSTM based model (TODO)
  - Combine LSTM and ARIMA (TODO)
  - Improve the LSTM by applying a wavelet transformation (TODO)
- Make a fully atomated Algorithmic Trading in python (In progress), see [Alg_Traiding.ipynb](https://github.com/viktor-begun/ML_Traiding/blob/main/Alg_Traiding.ipynb)
